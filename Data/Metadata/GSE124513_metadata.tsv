Di-DS3, +Shh+Pur,D14	GSM3535590	Public on Jan 01 2019	Dec 31 2018	Jan 01 2019	SRA	1	Cultured human iPSC-neural differentiated cells	Homo sapiens	individual: DS patient DS3	cell line: Di-DS3	cell type: iPSC derived cells	treatment: +Shh+Pur,D14	Organoids (5-week old) generated from hiPSC lines derived from two DS patients (patient DS1 and DS3 and corresponding cell lines include DS1, control1, isogenic Tri-DS3 and Di-DS3, Tri-DS3+ContshRNA, and Tri-DS3+OLIG2shRNA hiPSCs) were used for RNA-sequencing. For each cell line, total 40-60 organoids collected from three batches of organoid cultures were pool together for RNA extraction and sample preparation. By pooling organoids, we increased the chances of identifying genes that were commonly up- or down-regulated in the three batches of cultures, whereas on the other hand, we decreased the chances of identifying genes that had varied expression levels in the three batches of cultures.	total RNA	Total RNA was prepared with RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) (Chen et al., 2014) and libraries were constructed using 600 ng of total RNA from each sample and the TruSeqV2 kit from Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following manufacturers suggested protocol. The libraries were subjected to 75 bp paired read sequencing using a NextSeq500 Illumina sequencer to generate approximately 30 to 36 million paired-reads per sample.	9606	replicate 1	Fastq files were generated using the Bc12Fastq software, version 1.8.4. The genome sequence was then indexed using the rsem-prepare-reference command. Each fastq file was trimmed using the fqtrim program, and then aligned to the human genome using the rsem-calculate-expression (version 1.2.31) command to calculate FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) values.	All the results have been generated by our standard pipelines utilizing STAR as the aligner and RSEM as the tool for annotation and quantification at both gene and isoform levels.	The Excel files give normalized expression abundance in TPM and FPKM values for all the available genes.	The FPKM value (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) is the FPKM-normalized expression value for each gene/isoform. However, TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) has now becoming quite popular. TPM is very similar to FPKM. The only difference is the order of operations. Here’s how you calculate TPM: Divide the read counts by the length of each gene in kilobases. This gives you reads per kilobase (RPK). Count up all the RPK values in a sample and divide this number by 1,000,000. This is your “per million” scaling factor. Divide the RPK values by the “per million” scaling factor. This gives you the TPM value.	when calculating TPM, the only difference is that you normalize for gene length first, and then normalize for sequencing depth. However, the effects of this difference are quite profound. When you use TPM, the sum of all TPMs in each sample are the same. This makes it easier to compare the proportion of reads that mapped to a gene in each sample. In contrast, with RPKM and FPKM, the sum of the normalized reads in each sample may be different, and this makes it harder to compare samples directly.	In order to analyze the transcripts, FPKM > 1 was set as cutoff to filter transcripts. |Fold change | > 1.5 was set as criteria to filter differential expressed genes (DEGs). Upregulated and downregulated DEGs were mapped to each chromosome and the number of DEGs in each chromosome was counted. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID online tool (Huang da et al., 2009a; Huang da et al., 2009b) and visualized using GraphPad. Heatmaps were generated using pheatmap package of R. Correlations with Brainspan data were performed in R using only genes common to both experiments.  The average of the Spearman correlation coefficient is presented for all the combinations of organoid sample replicates or Brainspan samples matching the labeled condition.
