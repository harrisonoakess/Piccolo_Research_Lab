After 2-4 days, the cells formed a meshwork of dense ridges with mostly open spaces in between. The differentiation process was begun (day 0) by feeding the cells every other day for 12 days with NIM neural induction medium (Stem Cell Technologies), followed by DDM medium supplemented with 2% B27 [13] every other day for 12 days. On day 24, the dense ridges or islands containing neural progenitors were manually dissociated, resuspended in DDM + 2% B27 + 10 uM Y27632, and plated on dishes and chamber slides coated with poly-ornithine and laminin [14]. Every 4-5 days, half the medium was changed to fresh Neurobasal + 2% B27 + 2mM GlutaMax (Invitrogen). Colonies that were clearly nonneuronal were removed by scraping, rinsing and refeeding the cultures. After 40 days of differentiation, the cells were rinsed with PBS and harvested 140 with ice-cold Trizol or fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde + 4% sucrose in PBS. Successful differentiation of iPSCs into cortical neuronal cultures was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for markers of cortical layers V (transcription factor Ctip2, encoded by BCL11B) and VI (transcription factor TBR1), as well as for glutamatergic markers vGLUT1 (encoded by SLC17A7) and GRIK2.	polyA RNA	RNA for poly(A) RNA sequencing libraries was extracted from IPSC and neuronal cultures via TRIzol extraction.
