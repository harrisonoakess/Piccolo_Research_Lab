RNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the Illumina mRNA-seq Prep Kit as recommended by the manufacturer. The fragmented and randomly primed 150 bp paired-end libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000.	9606	Illumina Casava1.7 software used for basecalling.	Sequenced reads were filtered those adaptor comtiminated, unpaired, contains N , and  then mapped to hg19 whole genome using tophat 2.0.2 with default parameters	Reads count were calculated by htseq-count(Htseq Frame work v 0.6.0) with parameters  -s no	Reads Per Kilobase of exon per Megabase of library size (RPKM) were calculated using a protocol from Trapnell C, Nat. Biotechnol. 2010. In short, exons from all isoforms of a gene were merged to create one meta-transcript. The number of fragment falling in the exons of this meta-transcript were counted and normalized by the size of the meta-transcript and by the size of the library.
