Culture medium was supplemented with growth factors from 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/ Streptavidin to avoid bacterial growth and contamination.	total RNA	Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).	TruSeq RNA library preparation and Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing with 25 million 150bp single reads per library were performed by the Max Planck-Genome-Center Cologne, Germany.	9606	After quality control, reads were mapped using TopHat2 (v 2.0.9, default settings) against the Human Genome (version hg19).	Differential expression (log2FC, p-value, q-value) was done with cuffdiff (v2.1.1, default settings) using the accepted_hits.bam file for each sample comparing wild-type to trisomic cell line.
