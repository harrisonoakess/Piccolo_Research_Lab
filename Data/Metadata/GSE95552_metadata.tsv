Down syndrome CPC S1	GSM2516201	Public on Oct 05 2022	Mar 01 2017	Oct 06 2022	SRA	1	Down syndrome human iPSCs	Homo sapiens	tissue: cortical progenitor cells (CPCs)	cell type: in vitro differentiated cells	total RNA	Down syndrome and isogenic normal human iPSCs were differentiated for 24 days in vitro. Subconfluent DIV24 cells were harvested in Trizol lysis buffer (Qiagen RNAeasy). Total RNA  was collected using the RNAeasy reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.	mRNA-seq libraries were prepared from 1 ug of total RNA using the Illumina mRNA-seq Sample Preparation kit following the manufacturer’s instructions	9606	Raw dat was aligned to the transcriptome derived from UCSC genome assembly hg19, using STAR with default parameters.	Read counts for each transcript were measured using feature Counts	Differentilly expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 and a cut-off of 0.05 on adjusted p-valus (corrected for multipple hypotheses testing) was used fro creating lists and heatmaps.
