Each sample was transferred into a new tube, and plasma fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 1200 g for 10 min, while 5 mL of denaturing solution was added to the remaining blood fraction including the red blood cells and all the buffy coat, and stored at -20°C until RNA extraction.	total RNA	Total RNA extraction was performed with the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi. One or if necessary two purification steps were performed using RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 Kit in order to remove possible genomic DNA contamination and to reach the minimum concentration of 50 ng/μL.

Bases with a quality score less than 25 were removed as well as reads shorten than 35 nucleotides. The quality of the reads, before and after trimming, was checked with the software FASTQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).	High-quality reads were mapped against the GRCh38 human reference genome, downloaded from Ensembl (Cunningham et al., 2019), with the software STAR (version 2.5.2b, https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). Read summarisation was performed with featureCounts (http://subread.sourceforge.net/), only reads with a mapping quality higher than 30 were used for this scope.	The option -s 2 was used to indicate that the libraries are strand-specific.
